# SELF-STRIKE-ALPHA-CREATORS-COUNTERSPELL

our project consists of 3 different projects which are 
1. Jump the Gap
   this is similar to that of the kangaroo game. here we have to jump the certain gaps and escape them by clicking space.

   
2.Play with your clone
  The "shadow clones" represent the player's past actions becoming obstacles, embodying the idea that "you are your own enemy."
  The more you move and play, the harder it becomes to survive, as you create more challenges for yourself.

  
3.Type Speed
  In this limited time you have to type certain  words which are random and you have to type them within a certain duration of a time.
